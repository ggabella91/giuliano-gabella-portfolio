I'm a web developer with a passion for solving challenging problems and a never-ending desire to learn new things.

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from UCLA in 2015. My journey since then has been somewhat unconventional.

In 2016, I took a career break to go out and travel the world. When I returned, I quickly worked my way into the tech industry, having no doubt about what my passions and career interests were.

This is only the beginning, and I am fully committed to building a successful career in software engineering.
